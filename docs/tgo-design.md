## Purpose

The point of our design process is to have a repeatable way to start with a
problem and turn it into a solution that...
- works well with existing systems:
  - the ones you understand, and
  - and the ones you don't;
- has buy-in from the rest of the team;
- course-corrects early for design decisions that could be problematic;
- benefits from the intuition of the whole team without requiring deep
  involvement in the development cycle.

And, hopefully, one final benefit is that having a structured design process is
that when you take on a task that is kind of stretchy -- something you want
to do but don't know how -- there is a path already laid out on how to get to
an answer. The goal of SLS/TGO is to produce a game but it's also to give us
all opportunities to level up our disciplines and that mean we shouldn't have
to be afraid of not having the answer for how to tackle our next task.

## Suggested workflow

So you've got some job to do and you're not sure what the right way to do it is!
That's cool, let's get it sorted out:

1. Understand the problem.  
   Make sure you have a good grasp on the thing you even need to do! It's
   nearly impossible to solve a problem if you're building something with the
   wrong goal in mind. Examine the systems you are likely to interact with
   and the ones that you depend on. This will mostly take place in your head,
   by reading code / docs, and asking questions.
2. Write down the problem, and the problems.  
   Now that you know _what_ you're solving write it down. Write down the tricky
   parts and what you're unsure of. This may never get seen by anybody else but
   it will help you keep in your mind the things that feel important when doing
   your initial design.
3. Research existing solutions.  
   If relevant check for guides, tutorials,
