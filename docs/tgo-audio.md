# TGO Gameplan for Audio Engineering

## Current plan:

1. Start rolling our own in an AudioManager to handle background music
2. Learn/integrate some middleware (Wwise? fmod?)
3. Swap to that

## Middleware

Current most likely contender is the this [wwise-godot-integration][addon-repo] addon.
The authors demo it [here][addon-demo] in a talk to GodotCon 2021.

A short video of about the kinds of work that motivates Audio middleware is available [here][adaptive-audio].
